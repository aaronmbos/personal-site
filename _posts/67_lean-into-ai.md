Artificial intelligence has been around for a long time both in theory and practicality. Alan Turing developed the Turing Test as early as 1950 and since then there's been gradual advancements in the space of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As the technology has evolved we've found ways to integrate it into our lives through games like chess, search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and much more. So if all of this technology has been in place for so long what makes the recent advancements in **generative AI** and around OpenAI's ChatGPT different? Is there any substance behind all of the hype that it has received or is the hype not real? Honestly, I don't have answers to these questions, but I do have some thoughts that I'd like to get out of my head. Before I get too deep into my thoughts, let's take a moment to get on common ground in terms of technology and terminology starting with generative AI.
