When it comes to comprehensive command-line tools, FFmpeg definitely ranks among the top in terms of popularity and usage. FFmpeg was released in 2000 and has since become a household name in the video and audio processing industries. If you've had any experience with FFmpeg, you'll most likely know that as a tool it is both broad and deep. The breadth of functionality ranging from video to audio along with the depth of being able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, and filter media makes it a powerful, but potentially daunting tool. The good thing for users is that the documentation is comprehensive and complete, but due to the sheer magnitude of functionality it may be difficult for newcomers to digest. That's why I'd like to take a step back and see if we can break down this complex tool into some core fundamentals that provide a platform for learning more in the future. Let's start with the command specification.
