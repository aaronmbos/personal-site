## The Value of Being Uncomfortable

As I have progressed in my career there have been periods of time that I could feel myself growing and learning. I have made a concerted effort to push myself beyond my comfort zone as much as possible because I truly believe it leads to more growth and learning at a faster pace. For example, I have volunteered myself to look into problems that I wasn't totally sure I could solve at the time, which can be an uncomfortable feeling. The problems have ranged from high priority issues to long-standing bugs that required another set of eyes. Ultimately I don't think I gained the most from actually solving the problems themselves, more so the journey to the solution. Putting myself outside of my comfort zone and committing to solving a problem that I needed to learn about in order to solve has led to two common outcomes in my experience.

1. I'm surprised by my ability to solve the problem successfully
1. I learn a lot along the way

Let's talk about each of these outcomes in a little more detail. The first outcome of being surprised by one's ability occurs in situations where previous experience or knowledge contributes to developing a solution. This may not be direct experience or knowledge, but instead the ability to effectively piece together adjacent experiences to form a solution to a completely new problem. I can't say this outcome is the most common, but it has happened for me on several occasions.

The second outcome of simply learning a lot along the way is a little open ended. In this outcome a solution isn't guaranteed. We may come up against a problem that is out of our reach or requires conextual domain knowledge that we don't have yet. Even in cases where the problem isn't solved, so much can be learned along the way if approached with the right mindset. Getting outside of our comfort zone and into a situation where challenges are being faced at every step will inherently lead to learning new things. This new knowledge and skill can then be applied to the next problem and so on.

The main point I'd like to call out here is that neither of these outcomes are negative. Feeling uncomfortable isn't always fun and it can be challenging in the moment, but no matter the outcome we should be equipped with additional knowledge or skills that we didn't have before stepping out of our comfort zone.

A lot this may seem obvious so far, but I can tell you that it is easy to get overly comfortable in a role to the point where challenges seem like roadblocks instead of hurdles to be overcome. With that being said, I think there are times when stepping out of your comfort zone may not be the best idea for the given situation. For example, in times where there are tight external deadlines or pressure being placed on the team or individual. While I think there is still a lot of room for growth in this situtation, it may be best to take a supporting role especially if there are others who are well-positioned to tackle the problem. In a case where others are well suited to take on the project, it may be best to view it as a learning opportunity. How does this experienced engineer approach these problems and what leads to their success and failure. These can all be learned along the way in a supportive role. In cases when there aren't others well suited to take on the problem, that is when we can step up and take the risk. Like I said there's likely two outcomes with this risk taking and neither of them are negative.

The world of software and technology is expansive and offers endless opportunities for us to learn and grow. This is what I love about my career and the best way that I have found to take advantage of this fact is by operating at the edges of my ability. Continually be willing to feel uncomfortable in order to grow personally and help the teams that I work with achieve success in whatever challenges we are facing.
