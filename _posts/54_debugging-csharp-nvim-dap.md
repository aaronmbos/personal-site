Over the past few months Neovim has become my go to editor for all of my free time/side project coding needs. There have certainly been hurdles to overcome, but I really enjoy the experience and coding environment that Neovim provides. As I've continued to expand my Neovim understanding and environment configuration, I've been looking for more and more ways to integrate Neovim into my .NET development workflow. I've written a couple posts about .NET development in Neovim. One for general environment setup and another for Roslyn/.editorconfig integration. If you don't have your local development environment for Neovim setup yet, I would highly recommend checking out those posts. With all of that in place we should be ready to configure Neovim for the ability to run our application with a debugger.

First, I think it's valuable to talk about the plugin that makes this all possible. The only plugin that we need to install for debugging in Neovim is nvim-dap. I would highly recommendation reading more about nvim-dap on the GitHub repo, but at a very high level nvim-dap is a debug adapter protocol client implementation for Neovim. Nvim-dap provides the ability to run an application with a debugger, add breakpoints, step through code, inspect scopes, and much more. Neovim 0.8.0 is the recommended version for using nvim-dap, but the nightly build and 0.7.2 are also supported. Nvim-dap is a generic implementation than can plug into almost any debugger that follows the standard protocol. For the purpose of this post we are going to be focused on the use of nvim-dap for debugging .NET applications. Let's start with a list of steps that need we'll be going through.

1. Install nvim-dap plugin
1. Install netcoredbg adapter
1. Configure nvim-dap to use netcoredbg
1. Install dapui
1. Configure dapui for ease of use
1. Debug our apps ðŸ˜Ž

## Install nvim-dap

Nvim-dap can be installed just like any other Neovim plugin. I use Packer for plugin management so the install command looks like this. For the full installation documentation check out the README [here](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap#installation)

## Install netcoredbg

We now have nvim-dap installed, but in order to make it useful for .NET development we need to install a debug adapter. In this case the adapter is [netcoredbg](https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg). For installation, we can go to the releases page and download the latest release. At the time of writing the latest release is 2.2.0-947.

Once downloaded we need to unzip and move the netcoredbg executable and dependencies to a permanent location. I'm currently developing on a Mac and I chose `/usr/local/bin/netcoredbg`. Now we need to do a few things to make sure we can run the executable. First, we can run `chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/netcoredbg/*` to allow the current user to execute the files inside of `netcoredbg`. We also need to remove the quarantine label from the files since they were downloaded from the internet and Apple will not allow them to be run by default. I did this by running `find /usr/local/bin/netcoredbg/* | xargs xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine`.

## Configure nvim-dap

We now have nvim-dap and netcoredbg installed and are ready to configure nvim-dap to use netcoredbg. This step is actually very straightforward. The following code can be added to a lua block in `init.vim` or directly in a lua file that is ran as part of the Neovim runtime path. I think the only dynamic piece of the code is to make sure the `command` field is referencing the correct location for the netcoredbg executable.

```lua
local dap = require('dap')

dap.adapters.coreclr = {
  type = 'executable',
  command = '/usr/local/bin/netcoredbg/netcoredbg',
  args = {'--interpreter=vscode'}
}

dap.configurations.cs = {
  {
    type = "coreclr",
    name = "launch - netcoredbg",
    request = "launch",
    program = function()
        return vim.fn.input('Path to dll', vim.fn.getcwd() .. '/bin/Debug/', 'file')
    end,
  },
}
```
