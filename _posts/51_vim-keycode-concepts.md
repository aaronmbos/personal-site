title: "Learning Vim Keycode Concepts"
description: Since diving into the world of Vim and Neovim, I've felt myself become more comfortable with the tool and its idiosyncrasies. One of the the hurdles I faced early on was understanding the documention for different keycodes. In this post, we're going to cover the common keycodes and the concepts around them. Let's dive in!

## What are Keycodes?

I've adopted Vim (Neovim and other Vim editor plugins for VS Code and JetBrains) within the past year and the most challenging aspect was learning all of the different keymaps and motions. I will say that I am still learning, but have become pretty efficient with the foundational keymaps and motions in Vim. In my opinion one of Vim's greatest strengths is the robust documentation and manual pages. If you want to learn to do something in Vim, I guarantee it is documented somewhere in the man pages. I'm not going to say the information is always easy to find, but it is available if you're patient enough to search.

The power of Vim comes from the keyboard. The navigation and editing experience in Vim is different from almost all modern editors in that it prefers the use of the keyboard over the mouse. This difference in style can lead to a pretty steep learning curve and frustration. For me the frustration early on came from not being able to understand the different keycodes listed in the documentation. For example, when the documentation for performing a specific action references the `<Leader>` or `<C-j>` key, what exactly does this mean? Understanding what these keycodes mean, will allow us to gain more knowledge from the Vim documentation.
