I began using CockroachDB several months ago for the post reaction implementation (don't forget to like this post üòè). During the initial implementation I was hoping to use Postgres.js to connect to my CockroachDB serverless cluster. I unfortunately ran into a couple of stumbling blocks and opted to use the pg npm package, which is actually recommended in the CockroachDB documentation.

Using pg was fine, but I was still interested in Postgres.js for the following reasons.

- Easy to use API that allows for flexible and safe SQL query/command definitions
- Supports TypeScript out of the box
- ESM support (pg only supports CommonJS)
- Postgres.js markets itself as the fastest Postgres library for Node

I'll start off by saying that Postgres.js has great documentation and I think I could have got past my initial hurdles had I persisted, but I decided to take a path of "least resistance" and use pg instead. I was recently wishing for ESM and TypeScript support from my database methods, which prompted me to revisit Postgres.js. To get started we'll be working in a file called `db.js` that imports the `postgres` module.

```js
// db.js

import postgres from "postgres";

// connection details to come
```

At the heart of the database connection is the `postgres([url], [options])` method, which provides parameters to define the information required to connect to a database. In my case I'll be using a connection string URL, but the option is available to provide individual connection values as part of the object passed to the `postgres` method. The options provided will override any values that are in the connection string URL.

```js
// db.js

import postgres from "postgres";

// Always get sensitive information from the environment variables or secrets
const connectionString =
  "postgresql://user:password@db_server_url?sslmode=verify-full";

const sql = postgres(connectionString);

export default sql;
```

So far this is standard code for connecting to databases, the aspect that I stumbled on initially was the `sslmode=verify-full` option that requires a signed SSL certificate to connect. This SSL mode isn't "required", but it is strongly recommended for production clusters. I needed a way to provide the certificate to CockroachDB through this `postgres` method, but wasn't sure how.
