For me the end of the year is always an exciting time. It is a natural time to take a step back and reflect on that last 12 months. I also like to use this time to set goals and expectations for the upcoming year, which creates a cycle where I can review my progress and adjust expectations on a consistent schedule. Given that this is a technical blog I'm going to keep this post focused on the posts and work that I've done over the past year and also plan to do in the coming year.
