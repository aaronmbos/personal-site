For me the end of the year is always an exciting time. It is a natural time to take a step back and reflect on that last 12 months. I also like to use this time to set goals and expectations for the upcoming year, which creates a cycle where I can review my progress and adjust expectations on a consistent schedule. Given that this is a technical blog I'm going to keep this post focused on the posts and work that I've done over the past year and also plan to do in the coming year.

## Reflecting on Posts in 2022

In 2022 I published 36 blog posts (including this one), which is 12 more posts than I wrote last year. This means that I accomplished my target of publishing three posts per month (on average). I've had a bit of time to reflect on this post cadence and there were definitely times during the year when my posts felt a bit rushed. This may not have been solely due to the cadence, but also due to external factors (life, job change, etc.). In contrast my 2021 goal was to publish two posts per month and I don't recall feeling so many instances of last minute posts. I'll be revisiting post cadence when looking ahead to 2023.

After reviewing all of the posts that I wrote this year, I think they can mostly be grouped into three main categories.

1. Documenting my process of learning TypeScript
1. Mastering the local development experience with VS Code and Neovim
1. Grab bag topics that involved language features or personal experience

While I'm proud of the posts that I wrote this year, I feel like many of them lacked a bit of depth. I think this was partially due to the increased cadence, but also to a lack of planning on my part. Given that I planned to post three times in a month I could have been much more forward thinking in breaking down a topic and providing valuable depth over the course of multiple posts. What ended up happening was that I jumped from topic to topic with little cohesion. This isn't all bad since I don't really want my posts to be reliant on each other. You should be able to jump into any post and gain value without the requirement of reading a previous post (although knowledge from a previous post _can be helpful_).

In my recap [post](https://aaronbos.dev/posts/2021-year-review) from last year, I mentioned that I wanted to cover a wider range of topics beyond C#, .NET, and SQL. I definitely accomplished this by covering TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, Neovim, VS Code, and personal thoughts/opinions. Ultimately I'd like to continue this variety while providing more depth in each post.

## 2022 Feature Roadmap Review

Beyond the goals that I set for myself last year, I also planned to make a number of improvements to this site, which we're encompassed in a "[roadmap](https://github.com/aaronmbos/personal-site#feature-roadmap)". The roadmap included the following:

- Implement dark mode | **Q1** | [PR](https://github.com/aaronmbos/personal-site/pull/1)
- Share directly to Twitter from post | **Q2** | [PR](https://github.com/aaronmbos/personal-site/pull/2)
- TypeScript migration | **Q2** | [PR](https://github.com/aaronmbos/personal-site/pull/3)
- React to posts with emojis | **Q3** | [PR](https://github.com/aaronmbos/personal-site/pull/4)
- Search blog posts | **Q4** | [PR](https://github.com/aaronmbos/personal-site/pull/14)

I'm happy to say that I accomplished each of these milestones on time. A big contributor to my success on accomplishing these features was using the mini-roadmap as a guideline for me to stay focused throughout the year. I didn't want to fall into the trap of tinkering with my blog site, while not actually producing content. At the same time, the features that I included in the roadmap were valuable enough for me to prioritize over the course of the year. I'm going to continue to remain focused on generating quality content, while also not losing site that this blog is a project for me to improve my software development skills, which does involve making incremental improvements to the site itself.
