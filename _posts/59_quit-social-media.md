Social media has engrained itself into the fabric of our lives to the point of addiction. The dopamine hits that we receive from the likes, comments, retweets, and other interactions lead us to spend more time looking at our screens than most of us would like to admit. I've done my best to overcome this by setting screen time limits and deleting apps from my phone, but the end result always falls short of my ambitions. Regardless of my method of control I always found myself endlessly scrolling Twitter or just picking my phone up to refresh Instagram. My viewpoint of social media may be a little pessimistic and while I believe that it has been a net positive on the world, over time it has lost several aspects of what made it so special in the first place (at least for me).

I've been on social media since the days of MySpace. From there I moved to Facebook, then added Instagram, then Twitter, then Snapchat, then Reddit, and I even gave TikTok a try. Social media has made a huge impact on my life. My wife and I connected via mutual friends on Facebook. I was reached out to on Twitter for an exciting career opportunity. My parents can keep up with their grandkids via Instagram posts and stories. I'm sure thousands of others can share similar stories. **So why did I leave?**
