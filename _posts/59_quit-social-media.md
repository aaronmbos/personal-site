Social media has engrained itself into the fabric of our lives to the point of addiction. The dopamine hits that we receive from the likes, comments, retweets, and other interactions lead us to spend more time looking at our screens than most of us would like to admit. I've done my best to overcome this by setting screen time limits and deleting apps from my phone, but the end result always falls short of my ambitions. Regardless of my method of control I always found myself endlessly scrolling Twitter or just picking my phone up to refresh Instagram. My viewpoint of social media may be a little pessimistic and while I believe that it has been a net positive on the world, over time it has lost several aspects of what made it so special in the first place (at least for me).

I've been on social media since the days of MySpace. From there I moved to Facebook, then added Instagram, then Twitter, then Snapchat, then Reddit, and I even gave TikTok a try. Social media has made a huge impact on my life. My wife and I connected via mutual friends on Facebook. I was reached out to on Twitter for an exciting career opportunity. My parents can keep up with their grandkids via Instagram posts and stories. I'm sure thousands of others can share similar stories. **So why did I leave?**

## Time

Steve Jobs has been attributed with saying that _the most precious resource we all share is time_. Whether you believe that or not is up to you, but for me it is 100% true. We all have responsibilities that place constraints on the amount of time that we have available each day. As my number of responsibilities have grown the amount of time that I have outside of those responsibilities has dwindled. This may not be the case for everyone, but I assume it is for some. What this means for me is that the time that I don't have dedicated to my necessary obligations should be managed with great care.

I recently had the opportunity to take a step back and evaluate what is important to me. This list will most likely be different for everyone, but mine looks like this.

- Be the best husband that I can be.
- Be the best father that I can be.
- Maintain a high standard of physical and mental health.
- Be the best software engineer that I can be.

These are the priorities that I schedule my life around. They all require time and effort. You'll notice that having the most Twitter followers, getting the most retweets, or commenting on posts didn't make my list. For me, spending time on social media felt like timenot well spent. Looking at my screen time numbers at the end of each day felt demoralizing at times. Time spent on these social media platforms that provide an endlist list of posts and ads just seems to melt away.

I recently made the decision to delete my Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit accounts. I made the conscious decision to stay on LinkedIn and HackerNews (I'll go into why in the next section). Each of these apps are not inherently bad and if I'm being honest, **bits and pieces** of each of them could probably contribute to my core priorities positively. In the end the decision came down to the time spent on the platforms not being worth the value received from them.
