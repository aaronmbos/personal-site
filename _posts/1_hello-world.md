Considering that I'm a software engineer, I felt obliged to title this first post "Hello, World!". I'm assuming if you've landed here you probably know a little about me, but if not please check out my [about](https://aaronbos.dev/about) page to learn more! I'll keep this first one pretty short and to the point. Here we go!

### What To Expect From My Posts
My goal with this blog is to keep everything pretty centered around software and technology. I live and breathe it every day as a software engineer, so this will be a place where I can share my interests. This might include quick intros on new tech I'm getting into, deep dives into language or framework specifics, and possibly book reviews.

### Why Create a Blog?
Honestly, creating a blog has been something I've wanted to do since I became a software engineer in 2017. I've found so much value from reading blogs of people I look up to like [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/), [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) and random blog posts that explain a topic/problem I'm trying to learn/solve.

I am someone who is constantly trying to improve my skills and learn new things. I would like to use this blog as a place to aggregate what I'm learning with the hope that someone will stumble across a post and learn something too.

### How Often Will I Post?
My goal is to post twice per month. I think it will be a challenge, but still attainable. Jeff Atwood put it very elegantly in this [post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/).
> When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter.

I will do my best to hold myself accountable and stay consistent with posting content that is useful and entertaining (if you're into programming and tech).

I think that should just about do it for this first post. I'm really looking forward to writing and I hope you'll stay tuned for upcoming posts! Cheers!
