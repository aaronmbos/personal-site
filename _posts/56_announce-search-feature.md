title: "Introducing Search to the Blog"
description: "My blog's two year anniversary is coming up in January 2023 and in that time I've written 56 posts on a variety of topics. In order to provide some more visibility into posts without having to scroll through them all I've added the ability to search posts. In this post, we're going to talk a bit about the feature, its implementation, and how it might evolve in the future. Let's dive in!"
