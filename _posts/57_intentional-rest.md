There are times when life demands a lot from us and from time to time we just need a break from certain aspects to provide breathing room in others. For the purpose of this post, the concept of a "break" will mostly be focused around stepping away from an activity or activities that require effort (physical or mental). For me, this may be taking a break from work as a software engineer, taking a break from learning, or taking a break from working out. I'll be honest in saying that I'm not great at anticipating when I could benefit from a break and often times I'm never able to fully "shut off" whatever I'm trying to take a break from.

I was recently lucky enough to take a break from just about everything. My wife and I took a much needed trip together and I had the opportunity to step away from work, parenting, learning, working, etc.. This provided my wife and I an opportunity to recharge our batteries completely, while also being able to spend some great time together. For me, I think the aspect of this break that made it beneficial was that I made an **intentional** decision to step away from my normal day to day completely. This meant not checking Slack or email, not thinking about my next blog post, not worrying about what I'm going to learn next, not worrying when my next run is going to be, and all the things in life that I typically enjoy but also require a lot of mental and physical energy over time. This intentionality is what I want to focus on and potentially think about how it can be applied in smaller increments to result in similar benefits.

So first, what do I mean by being "intentional" about rest? To me being intentional involves actively thinking about something before acting, versus passively letting action happen to ourselves. For example, my wife and I could have gone on vacation and without intentionally thinking about my behavior I most likely would have continued to read Slack messages and emails from work, stay up to date on software development newsletters, check HackerNews and Twitter, and many of the things that I've already mentioned. Would it have still be a good vacation? Most likely, but would I have been come back from vacation as rested, recharged, and ready to get back to the rigors of daily life as I did when I was intentional about truly stepping away? _I don't think so._
